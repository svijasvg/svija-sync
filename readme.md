Svija Sync is a **script**, a tiny app that just does one thing.

As long as it's running, it will **keep your website synchronized with your computer**.

You can also use it to download all the files needed for working on your website.

# Download the App

1. Click the green button **Clone or download** at the top right of this page then choose **Download ZIP**.

2. **Open the downloaded ZIP file** (if it didn't happen automatically).

2. **Drag the appropriate TXT document** (EN or FR version) into a new working folder where all your website files will be kept.

*Put the other files in the Trash.*

# Add Your Credentials

1. **Click twice on the TXT document** to open it in TextEdit.

2. Replace the "**x**" on the fourth line with the **three lines of red text** in the email you've received from Svija:  

```
site='example.com'  
user='example'  
pass='#r4nd0m#'  
```
*Save the changes and quit TextEdit.*

# Start the App

Rename the app to **sync.commmand**

**Click twice** on the app to run it. You may see a warning:

"Svija Sync.command" can't be opened because it is from an unidentified developer.

To continue, open **System Preferences** › **Security and Privacy** › **General**

At the bottom you'll see:

>"Svija Sync.command" was blocked from opening because it is not from an identified developer.

Click the button **[Open Anyway]**

# Once the App is Running

Choose **Download** to create the **sync** folder containing your website files.

You now have everything you need to update your website in the **"sync" folder**.

If you will be using Svija regularly, the [Svjia Illustrator scripts](https://github.com/svijasvg/illustrator-scripts) will make your life much easier. You can download them [here](https://github.com/svijasvg/illustrator-scripts).

# General Usage

Whenever you want to work on your website, **double-click "Svija Sync.comand" to start syncronizing** your website.

As long as the app is running, your files will be synchronized every five seconds.
